 <h3 style="color: Red">
                <p>Customer churn has become highly important for companies because of increasing competition among
companies, increased importance of marketing strategies and conscious behaviour of customers in the
recent years. Customers can easily trend toward alternative services. Companies must develop various
strategies to prevent these possible trends, depending on the services they provide.
